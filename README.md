# rip-oppy
# #Project Description
rip-oppy is a retro-theme interface that outputs a precise distance bewteen the user's coordinates and the rover Opportunity's (Oppy) location on Mars at the current time. This project was created as a tribute for Opportunity's legacy on Mars exploration and data collection. 
Some of the tecnologies used to develop this project and its purposes include:
-  The JPL Horizons solar system data and ephemeris computation service from NASA to create a query to get coordinates for both the user and Opportunity's location with respect to the same reference frame. 
- A reverse geocode function to convert addresses to accurate geocoordinates
- A functions that computates the user's curretn time in UTC  <br />

In the future, some of the features that can be implemented to the program are Oppy's birthday, statistics about the mission, and even calculating the dates when Oppy will be the closest to the user's location on Earth.
