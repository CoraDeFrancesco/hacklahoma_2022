# #Project Description
rip-oppy is a retro-theme interface that outputs a precise distance bewteen your coordinates and the rover Opportunity's location on Mars at the current time. This project was created as a tribute for Opportunity's legacy on Mars exploration and data collection. 
Some of the tecnologies used to develop this project and its purposes included:
-  The JPL Horizons solar system data and ephemeris computation service from NASA to create a query get coordinates for both the user and Opportunity's location with respect to the same reference frame.
- A reverse geocode function to convert addresses to accurate geocoordinates
In the future, some of the features that can be added to the program are Oppy's birthday, statistics about the mission, and even calculationg when Oppy will be the closeset to the user's location. 
# #How to Use the Project 
Install rip-oppy by typing in your command line `pip install rip-oppy 1.0.0`
